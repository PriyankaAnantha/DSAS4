Portions- 
for class test on 05-Apr-2024 are as follows:
1. Arrays - 1D and 2D representations, memory address for contents.
2. Stacks and Queues - Both array and linked list implementations.

---> Lecture 1 to 6
Topics covered in Assignment-01.
---> 1.  Modify the Doubly Linked List code (DoublyLinkedList.c) provided with this assignment to
implement a Singly Linked List
2.  Queue operations implementation using the Singly Linked List implementation
3.  Using a Doubly Linked List, perform polynomial addition.
4. converting a given Inx expression to a Postx expression using doubly linked list implementation of stack. 


Note: First, be familiar with all the topics discussed in the class and then read the corresponding materials from 
Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) textbook.

Stack Array - Implementation of stacks using Arrays

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

1. global variable declarations and function prototypes for various stack operations.
    1. variables int S_size= 5; stack size, predefined for we are using array in the implementation and array needs to have fixed size and int S_top = -1; top of stack

    2. stack operation Function prototypes declarations
